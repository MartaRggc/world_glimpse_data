# World_glimpse (in construction)

Hey there! Welcome to the repo of my final proyect of the Ironhack Data Analytics course in Madrid: World Glimpse.

World Glimpse is an api built-on app with which you will be able to explore different aspects of world countries and regions to get an overall idea of their characteristics and current situation. Some aspects you will find in the app are:

+ General: Main spoken langguages, demographic population, size, climate.
+ Social: Well-being and social indicators, such as the poverty index or the sexism rating.
+ Political: Government system, country leader and current government group name, on-going conflicts if existing, etc.
+ Economical: Median salary, PIB, relative power adquisition indexes such as PPP, economic sectors proportions.
+ Cultural: Regional dances or traditions. Famous artists from different fields.
+ Sports: Most popular sports, famous players.

A subsection of news for each country is also included, based on calls to [newscatcherapi](https://newscatcherapi.com/), with a translation into the user's own langguage.
The user's activity is registered along time, which allows customization of some features such as the content of the lateral bar when no country is yet selected.

# About the technical part:

The interface is built within streamlit and is fed with data provided by an api created through fastapi. 
More details will be shown here as the proyect evolves! Keep track ;)
